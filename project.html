        <h2>404 Job Not Found - Development Plan</h2>

        <h3>1. Team/Client/App</h3>
        <p><strong>Team Name:</strong> 404 Job Not Found</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Team Members:</strong> Alhan Walli, Aryan Minhas, Marko
          Kosoric, Sepantha Kamali, Umer Qureshi
        </p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Dr. Vincent Maccio</p>
        <p><strong>App:</strong> MacHub</p>

        <h3>2. Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Our app, MacHub, is designed to help McMaster University students
          collaborate, share, and access high-quality class notes in an
          organized and rewarding way. By allowing students to securely upload
          their notes, categorized by course and topic. The app creates a hub of
          academic resources accessible to both peers and professors. To
          encourage academic collaboration and support, users can rate notes,
          leave feedback, and the highest-rated contributions will be recognized
          with rewards such as bonus marks or other incentives.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Data Description</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User Data:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Each user is uniquely identified by their mac_id.</li>
              <li>
                Users have attributes like name, email, and password (hashed for
                security).
              </li>
              <li>
                A role field differentiates users as students, teaching
                assistants (TAs), or instructors.
              </li>
              <li>The date_joined field records when the user registered.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Course Data:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Each course is uniquely identified by a course_code.</li>
              <li>
                Courses have associated names, instructors, and semester
                details.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Notes Data:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Notes are uniquely identified by an auto-incrementing note_id.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each note is uploaded by a user (linked via mac_id) and belongs
                to a specific course (course_code).
              </li>
              <li>The title, description, and file_url store note details.</li>
              <li>A timestamp records when the note was uploaded.</li>
              <li>
                Notes can be public or private, managed through the visibility
                field.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ratings and Reviews Data:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ratings are uniquely identified by an auto-incrementing
                rating_id.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each rating is linked to a specific note (note_id) and given by
                a user (mac_id).
              </li>
              <li>
                Users can rate notes on a scale of 1 to 5 and leave comments.
              </li>
              <li>A timestamp records when the rating was submitted.</li>
            </ul>

              <li>Users upload notes, which are tied to specific courses.</li>
              <li>Other users can rate and review these notes.</li>
              <li>
                Deleting a user or course cascades the deletion of related notes
                and ratings, maintaining database integrity.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <h3>5. Role of PHP and JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          In our app, PHP will be used primarily for server-side operations such
          as handling user registration and login, processing file uploads,
          managing database interactions (including inserting, updating, and
          deleting notes, ratings, and rewards). PHP will also serve as the
          backend for endpoints that JavaScript will communicate with.
          JavaScript, on the other hand, will be used for client-side
          functionality, including form validation, dynamic display of notes,
          search and sort features, real-time interactions such as rating notes,
          displaying leaderboards, and showing upload progress. JavaScript will
          use AJAX to send data to the PHP backend and update the page without
          requiring reloads. Together, PHP and JavaScript will work to create a
          smooth user experience with JavaScript capturing user actions and PHP
          securely processing them.

        <h3>7. Incremental Delivery</h3>
        <p>
          The first increment of our app will focus on developing the frontend
          interface for uploading notes. This will include creating a clean and
          user-friendly upload page with a form that allows users to select a
          course from a dropdown menu, enter a title and description for their
          notes, and upload a file in PDF or DOCX format. Client-side validation
          will be implemented to ensure all fields are filled correctly and that
          only valid file types and sizes are accepted. A version of the login
          system may also be implemented, utilizing a mac ID and emails.
        </p>
