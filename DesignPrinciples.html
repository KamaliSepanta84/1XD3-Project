    <h1>Bad Web App Design:</h1>
    <h2>We chose to critique the website for Yale School of Art, 
       adhering to the UI design principles in chapter 12. 
       For reference, <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">click here to view the website</a> 
    </h2>

    <h2>Consistency:</h2>
    <p class = "UI-principle">
        The website follows a consistent design scheme. Between pages the structure, fonts, and layouts are all the same. Despite this there is a vast contrast in the colour scheme between pages. For example, the majority of the pages have a black and white background colour scheme, via an image. However, the public events page has a pink theme in its background and the apply to the school page has no image in the background.

    </p>
    <h2>Ease of Navigation</h2>
    <p class = "UI-principle">
        Links are scattered all over the webpage and are not clearly highlighted to the user because they’re not in a central position and are in the same font style as regular paragraph text. For example, the white box at the top left of the page has important links but is located in an area that the user would not pay attention to normally. The login form should be centered or in a prominent area but it is in the bottom left. Although the website has different sections that make it organized, the different box sizes can be confusing for the reader.
    </p>
    <h2>Universal Usability</h2>
    <p class = "UI-principle">
        When navigating on a desktop, the website does not use the whole screen as there is a huge gap on the right side of the screen. The website uses media queries to make the mobile experience a lot better, however, there is often more than one block of information displayed side by side. This makes it hard for the user to quickly find information. The website does not have many accessibility features either. For example, there is an alt feature, but it does not provide a text description of the image. 
    </p>
    <h2>Error Prevention</h2>
    <p class = "UI-principle">
        The website seems to have no errors when viewing the developer console, however using an HTML Validator there are 29 errors and 37 warnings in the HTML code of the document. The most common errors include a stray end tag for links (a) and paragraphs (p) an example of this can be seen in line 17 of the code. Furthermore there are multiple unclosed elements, mostly including the div element, which can be seen in line 70. Finally another consistent issue is the use of the font tag, which is now obsolete and an alternative should be used on CSS. In terms of CSS using the validator we see that there are 3 main errors, of which a unit is forgotten at the end of a number,  “” is not a value and misunderstanding the behaviour of img properties.

    <h1>Good Web App Design:</h1>
    <h2>We chose to critique the website Apple, 
       adhering to the UI design principles in chapter 12. 
       For reference, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/" target="_blank">click here to view the website</a> 
    </h2>

    <h2>Consistency:</h2>
    <p class = "UI-principle">
        The website follows a consistent design and colour scheme between all pages. Each page looks and acts as part of the same website making navigating through easy. For example the page for each individual product follows the same as showing models at the top of the page, with features unique to Apple below, all with a dark gray and white colour theme. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ease of Navigation</h2>
    <p class = "UI-principle">
        The webpage has a black navigation bar visible to the user at all times for ease of navigation. Hovering over text in the bar will automatically drop down a box with relevant links and info to guide the user. Furthermore the apple logo, search bar and shopping cart are used as easy to recognize links. The website only has a vertical scroll, with further buttons all highlighted in bright blue to contrast the background. Additionally all buttons are centered in the website and there is no blank space. Finally all irrelevant links and help are linked at the bottom of the website which guide the user who can’t get to their location from above. 
    </p>
    <h2>Universal Usability</h2>
    <p class = "UI-principle">
        The website uses media queries so that the website smoothly transitions from a desktop layout to a mobile layout. For example, when the page gets smaller the links at the top of the header are removed and put into a single dropdown menu making it easier for the user to navigate the website. The website also sets queries that contain max and minimum widths which forces a narrow and centered layout.
    </p>
    <h2>Error Prevention</h2>
    <p class = "UI-principle">
        Compared to the bad website the Apple website has only 5 HTML errors compared to the previous 29. The errors are all due to attributes not being allowed in elements and also elements not having the right attributes. Furthermore when checking CSS errors we see 79, but they are all vendor extension errors this is due to Apple using an external vendor. These errors have no effect on the aesthetics and structure of the website. On the developer console we see a syntax error    </p>
